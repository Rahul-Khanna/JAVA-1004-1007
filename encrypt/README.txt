A simple encryption algorithm. Takes in three inputs from the command line, an encryption string, input file and output file. The encryption string can be any sequence of uppercase letters of at least length 1. The way the encryption works is that a new alphabet is created by taking making the letters in the encryption string be the first letters of the new alphabet and then whatever letter are left are put into the new alphabet backwards, i.e. Z would go before A. The program then takes in an input file and encrypts it with the newly created alphabet and prints out the encrypted version on the output file. The program can also decrypt the output file, just make sure the encryption string is the same.
